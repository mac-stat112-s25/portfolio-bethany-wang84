title: "Bivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **bivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
# Load required packages
library(tidyverse)

# 1. Read Palmer Penguins data from GitHub
df <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv"
)

# 2. Filter to complete cases for the two variables we'll plot
df_clean <- df %>%
  drop_na(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm)

# 3. Bivariate scatterplot with linear trend line
ggplot(df_clean, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm)) +
