title: "Trivariate Viz"
---

Use this file to generate a professional looking **trivariate** visualization.  The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.
```{r}
# Load needed packages
library(tidyverse)

# 1. Read Palmer Penguins data from GitHub
penguins <- read_csv(
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins/master/inst/extdata/penguins.csv"

# 2. Filter to complete cases for the three variables we'll plot
penguins_clean <- penguins %>%
  drop_na(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, species)

# 3. Trivariate scatterplot:

#    – y: bill_depth_mm
#    – color: species (third variable)
ggplot(penguins_clean,
