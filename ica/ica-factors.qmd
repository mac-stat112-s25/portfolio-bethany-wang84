# Exercise 1: Changing Order

# a) Manually specify grade levels from highest to lowest, with 'S' and 'AU' last
grade_distribution %>%
  mutate(
    grade = factor(
      grade,
      levels = c("A","A-","B+","B","B-","C+","C","C-","D+","D","D-","NC","S","AU")
    )
  ) %>%

    labs(
      title = "Grade Distribution (Manual Order)",
      x = "Grade",
      y = "Count"
    )
# • factor(..., levels=...) sets the exact ordering of grade categories.

# b) Reorder grades by ascending frequency
grade_distribution %>%
  mutate(grade = fct_reorder(grade, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = grade, y = n)) +
    geom_col() +
    labs(
      title = "Grade Distribution (Ascending Frequency)",
      x = "Grade (Least to Most Frequent)",
      y = "Count"
    )
# • fct_reorder(grade, n) reorders factor levels by the numeric 'n' in ascending order.

# c) Reorder grades by descending frequency
grade_distribution %>%
  mutate(grade = fct_reorder(grade, n, .desc = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = grade, y = n)) +
    geom_col() +
    labs(
      title = "Grade Distribution (Descending Frequency)",
      x = "Grade (Most to Least Frequent)",
      y = "Count"
    )
# • fct_reorder(..., .desc=TRUE) flips the order to descending.

# Exercise 2: Changing Factor Level Labels

  # First ensure the manual order
  mutate(
    grade = factor(
      grade,
      levels = c("A","A-","B+","B","B-","C+","C","C-","D+","D","D-","NC","S","AU")
    )
  ) %>%
  # Then recode two levels for clarity
  mutate(
    grade = fct_recode(
      grade,
      Audit        = "AU",
      Satisfactory = "S"
    )
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = grade, y = n)) +
    geom_col() +
    labs(
      title = "Grade Distribution with Clear Labels",
      x = "Grade",
      y = "Count"
    )
# • fct_recode(...) renames selected factor levels, leaving others unchanged.
