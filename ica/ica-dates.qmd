# Exercise 1a: More Filtering
# Keep only Adelie and Chinstrap using %in%
penguins %>% 
  filter(species %in% c("Adelie", "Chinstrap")) %>% 
  count(species)
# %in% keeps rows where species is one of the two

# Keep only Adelie and Chinstrap using !=
penguins %>% 
  filter(species != "Gentoo") %>% 
  count(species)
# species != "Gentoo" drops Gentoo, leaving the other two

# Exercise 1b: Handling NAs
# Count how many penguins missing body_mass_g
penguins %>% summarize(missing = sum(is.na(body_mass_g)))
# Remove only those missing body_mass_g
penguins_w_body_mass <- penguins %>% filter(!is.na(body_mass_g))
# Remove rows missing *any* variable (use sparingly!)
penguins_complete <- penguins %>% na.omit()
# na.omit() drops rows with ANY NA; use only when you truly need complete cases

# Exercise 2: More Selecting
# Keep everything except year and island
penguins %>% select(-year, -island)

# Keep species and all measurements in millimeters
penguins %>% select(species, ends_with("_mm"))

# Keep species and all bill-related measurements
penguins %>% select(species, starts_with("bill"))

# Keep species and all length-related measurements
penguins %>% select(species, contains("length"))

# Exercise 3: Arranging, Counting, Grouping by Multiple
# Sort by species then island
penguins %>% arrange(species, island)

# Count male/female by species
penguins %>% count(species, sex)

# Average body mass by species and sex
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species, sex) %>% 
  summarize(mean_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))

# Exercise 4: Dates with lubridate
today <- as.Date(today())
class(today)           # "Date"
year(today)            # 2025
month(today)           # 5
month(today, label=TRUE)  # "May"
week(today)            # 19 (ISO week)
mday(today)            # 7 (day of month)
yday(today)            # 127 (day of year)
wday(today)            # 4 (1 = Sunday)
wday(today, label=TRUE)  # "Wed"
today >= ymd("2024-02-14")  # TRUE
today <  ymd("2024-02-14")  # FALSE

# Exercise 5: Birthdays dataset
data("Birthdays")
# How many days of data per state?
Birthdays %>% count(state)

# Total births overall
Birthdays %>% summarize(total_births = sum(births))

# Total births per state, sorted lowâ†’high
Birthdays %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(births)) %>% 
  arrange(total)

# Exercise 6: daily_births and plot
daily_births <- Birthdays %>% 
  group_by(date, wday) %>% 
  summarize(total_births = sum(births), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(daily_births, aes(x = date, y = total_births, color = wday)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Total Births", color = "Weekday")

# Exercise 7a: Monthly births over time
monthly_births <- Birthdays %>% 
  mutate(month = month(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(year, month) %>% 
  summarize(births = sum(births), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(monthly_births, aes(x = month, y = births, group = year, color = factor(year))) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Total Births", color = "Year")
# Seasonal peaks and troughs emerge, consistent patterns year-to-year.

# Exercise 7b: Weekly births in 1988 by state (drop week 53)
weekly_1988 <- Birthdays %>% 
  filter(year == 1988) %>% 
  mutate(week = week(date)) %>% 
  filter(week != 53) %>% 
  group_by(state, week) %>% 
  summarize(births = sum(births), .groups = "drop")

ggplot(weekly_1988, aes(x = week, y = births, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Total Births", color = "State")
# Notice seasonal trends differ by state

# Exercise 7c: Compare MN vs LA in 1988
mn_la_1988 <- weekly_1988 %>% filter(state %in% c("MN", "LA"))

ggplot(mn_la_1988, aes(x = week, y = births, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Week", y = "Total Births", color = "State")
# MN and LA show different seasonal patterns reflecting climate differences

# Exercise 8: More Practice
# a) MA in 1979, sorted by births descending
Birthdays %>% 
  filter(state == "MA", year == 1979) %>% 
  arrange(desc(births))

# b) Top 5 states by total births from 1979-09-09 to 1979-09-12
Birthdays %>% 
  filter(date >= ymd("1979-09-09"), date <= ymd("1979-09-12")) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(births), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
