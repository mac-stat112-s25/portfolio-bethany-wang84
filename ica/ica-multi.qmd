# Exercise 1a: Plot average SAT scores by state
ggplot(education, aes(x = reorder(State, sat), y = sat)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "State", y = "Average SAT")
# • Range: ~900 to ~1100
# • Typical: most states around ~1000
# • Shape: a few high‐scoring outliers, slight skew
# • Non‐normal: extreme values (e.g. small states or selective testers)

# Exercise 2a: SAT vs per‐pupil spending
ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Expenditure per Pupil (thousands $)", y = "Average SAT")
# Trend: slight negative slope—higher spending ↔ lower SAT overall

# Exercise 2a: SAT vs teacher salary
ggplot(education, aes(x = salary, y = sat)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Average Teacher Salary (thousands $)", y = "Average SAT")
# Trend: flat-to-slight negative—no clear positive link between salary and SAT

# Exercise 3: Trivariate viz (sat ~ expend colored by salary)
ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, color = salary)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(color = "Salary (k$)", x = "Spending (k$)", y = "Average SAT")
# • Color gradient shows salary levels
# • Both higher spending and higher salary states tend to cluster differently,
#   but overall relationships remain weak/negative

# Exercise 4: Discretize spending into 2 groups
ggplot(education, aes(x = salary, y = sat, color = cut(expend, 2))) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(color = "Spending Group", x = "Salary (k$)", y = "Average SAT")
# • cut(...,2) splits into low/high spending
# • If cut(...,3), you get low/medium/high—more nuance
# • Within each spending group, SAT and salary trend positive or flat

# Exercise 5a: Univariate viz of fracCat
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "lightgreen") +
  labs(x = "SAT Participation Category", y = "Number of States")
# • Shows counts: most states medium (15–45%), fewer low (<15%) or high (>45%)

# Exercise 5b: SAT vs fracCat (boxplot & violin)
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat, y = sat)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "orange") +
  labs(x = "Participation Category", y = "Average SAT")
# • Low participation → highest median SAT
# • High participation → lowest median SAT

ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat, y = sat)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, fill = "purple", alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(x = "Participation Category", y = "Average SAT")
# • Violin confirms boxplot pattern and shows full distribution shape

# Exercise 5c: Trivariate viz (sat ~ expend colored by fracCat)
ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(color = "Participation", x = "Spending (k$)", y = "Average SAT")
# • Within each fracCat group, spending and SAT correlate positively
# • Overall negative trend is due to mixing groups with different fracCat

# Exercise 5d: Simpson’s Paradox explanation
# • Low‐participation states (small test‐taker fraction) have high SAT but low spending.
# • High‐participation states have lower SAT but higher spending.
# • Aggregating creates a misleading negative overall correlation,
#   whereas controlling for fracCat reveals the true within‐group positive relationships.
