```{r}
# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```

```{r}
# Exercise 1:
# Categorical (rating): observed categories, counts/proportions, relative prevalence,
#                       logical order, clear axis labels.
# Quantitative (elevation): range, center (mean/median), shape (skewness), spread, outliers.

# Exercise 2: load ggplot tools
library(tidyverse)  # loads ggplot2 for visualization

# Exercise 3–5: Bar chart of difficulty ratings
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes") +
  theme_minimal()
# • Shows the three observed difficulty levels
# • Counts per level reveal that “moderate” is most common

# Exercise 6: Bar chart of elevation (ineffective for continuous data)
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
# • A bar for each unique elevation leads to clutter
# • Fails to reveal overall distribution shape

# Exercise 8–10: Histograms of elevation

# Default bins
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
# • Rough view of distribution; bin boundaries may be arbitrary

# White borders for clarity
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
# • Separates bins visually, improving readability

# Blue fill
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
# • Combines border and fill for better aesthetics

# Oversmoothed (binwidth = 1000)
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
# • Very wide bins hide detail; distribution too coarse

# Noisy (binwidth = 5)
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
# • Very narrow bins create noisy, spiky plot

# Balanced (binwidth = 200)
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
# • Binwidth reveals center, spread, skew, and outliers effectively

# Exercise 11: Density plot of elevation
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density(color = "blue", fill = "orange", alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Density")
# • Smooth distribution (area = 1), shows typical elevation, variability, skewness
