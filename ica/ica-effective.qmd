# Load tidyverse package for plotting and wrangling
library(tidyverse)

# Import the data
weather <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/weather_3_locations.csv") |> 
  mutate(date = as.Date(date))
```


```{r}
# Exercise 1a & 1b: Professionalism
#| fig-cap: "Scatterplot of 9 am vs 3 pm temperatures in three Australian locations."
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp9am, y = temp3pm, color = location)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(
    x     = "Morning Temperature (°C)",      # A: short label with units
    y     = "Afternoon Temperature (°C)",    # B: short label with units
    title = "Daily Temperature Comparison",  # C: <10-word descriptive title
    color = "Location"                       # D: legend title
  )
# Answers for Part a:
# A = "Morning Temperature (°C)"
# B = "Afternoon Temperature (°C)"
# C = "Daily Temperature Comparison"
# D = "Location"

# Exercise 2: Accessibility
#| fig-cap: "Density plots of 3 pm temperatures in three Australian locations."
#| fig-alt: "Overlaid density curves of 3 pm temperatures in Hobart, Uluru, and Wollongong, showing Hobart’s temps cluster around 15–20 °C, Uluru’s cluster around 25–30 °C, and Wollongong in between. Data from mac-stat.github.io."
ggplot(weather, aes(x = temp3pm, fill = location)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + 
  labs(
    x    = "3 pm Temperature (°C)",
    fill = "Location"
  )
# Accessibility notes:
# - fig-alt describes plot type, locations, key takeaway, and data source.
# - Test colors under color-blind simulators; consider scale_fill_viridis_d() for a color-blind–safe palette.
